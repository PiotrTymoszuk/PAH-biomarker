abstract = {Background: Sepsis, a dysregulated host response following infection, is associated with massive immune activation and high mortality rates. There is still a need to define further risk factors and laboratory parameters predicting the clinical course. Iron metabolism is regulated by both, the body's iron status and the immune response. Iron itself is required for erythropoiesis but also for many cellular and metabolic functions. Moreover, iron availability is a critical determinant in infections because it is an essential nutrient for most microbes but also impacts on immune function and intravascular oxidative stress. Herein, we used a prospective study design to investigate the putative impact of serum iron parameters on the outcome of sepsis. Methods: Serum markers of iron metabolism were measured in a prospective cohort of 61 patients (37 males, 24 females) with sepsis defined by Sepsis-3 criteria in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Regulation of iron parameters in patients stratified by focus of infection and co-medication as well as association of the markers with sepsis severity scores and survival were investigated with linear and logistic regression corrected for sex and age effects. Results: Positive correlations of increased serum iron and ferritin concentrations upon ICU admission with the severity of organ failure (SOFA score) and with mortality were observed. Moreover, high TF-Sat, elevated ferritin and serum iron levels and low transferrin concentrations were associated with reduced survival. A logistic regression model consisting of SOFA and transferrin saturation (SOFA-TF-Sat) had the best predictive power for survival in septic ICU patients. Of note, administration of blood transfusions prior to ICU admission resulted in increased TF-Sat and reduced survival of septic patients. Conclusions: Our study could show an important impact of serum iron parameters on the outcome of sepsis. Furthermore, we identified transferrin saturation as a stand-alone predictor of sepsis survival and as a parameter of iron metabolism which may in a combined model improve the prediction power of the SOFA score. Trial registration: The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki on biomedical research. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review board of the Medical University Innsbruck (study AN2013-0006).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND After the 2002/2003 SARS outbreak, 30% of survivors exhibited persisting structural pulmonary abnormalities. The long-term pulmonary sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are yet unknown, and comprehensive clinical follow-up data are lacking. METHODS In this prospective, multicentre, observational study, we systematically evaluated the cardiopulmonary damage in subjects recovering from COVID-19 at 60 and 100 days after confirmed diagnosis. We conducted a detailed questionnaire, clinical examination, laboratory testing, lung function analysis, echocardiography, and thoracic low-dose computed tomography (CT). RESULTS Data from 145 COVID-19 patients were evaluated, and 41% of all subjects exhibited persistent symptoms 100 days after COVID-19 onset, with dyspnea being most frequent (36%). Accordingly, patients still displayed an impaired lung function, with a reduced diffusing capacity in 21% of the cohort being the most prominent finding. Cardiac impairment, including a reduced left ventricular function or signs of pulmonary hypertension, was only present in a minority of subjects. CT scans unveiled persisting lung pathologies in 63% of patients, mainly consisting of bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or reticulation in the lower lung lobes, without radiological signs of pulmonary fibrosis. Sequential follow-up evaluations at 60 and 100 days after COVID-19 onset demonstrated a vast improvement of both, symptoms and CT abnormalities over time. CONCLUSION A relevant percentage of post-COVID-19 patients presented with persisting symptoms and lung function impairment along with pulmonary abnormalities more than 100 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, our results indicate a significant improvement in symptoms and cardiopulmonary status over time.},

abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive, fatal disease. We studied 674 consecutive adult patients who were prospectively enrolled in the French PAH registry (121 incident and 553 prevalent cases). Two survival analyses were performed. First, the cohort of 674 patients was followed for 3 yrs after study entry and survival rates described. Then, we focused on the subset with incident idiopathic, familial and anorexigen-associated PAH (n=56) combined with prevalent patients who were diagnosed <3 yrs prior to study entry (n=134). In the cohort of 674 patients, 1-, 2-, and 3-yr survival rates were 87% (95% CI 84-90), 76% (95% CI 73-80), and 67% (95% CI 63-71), respectively. In prevalent idiopathic, familial and anorexigen-associated PAH, 1-, 2-, and 3-yr survival rates were higher than in incident patients (p=0.037). In the combined cohort of patients with idiopathic, familial and anorexigen-associated PAH, multivariable analysis showed that survival could be estimated by means of a novel risk-prediction equation using patient sex, 6-min walk distance, and cardiac output at diagnosis. This study highlights survivor bias in prevalent cohorts of PAH patients. Survival of idiopathic, familial and anorexigen-associated PAH can be characterised by means of a novel risk-prediction equation using patients' characteristics at diagnosis.

abstract = {Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, severe disease characterized by worsening right-sided heart failure, decreasing functional status, and poor survival. The present study characterizes the 5-year survival in the United States of a new and previous diagnosis of PAH in patients stratified by baseline functional class (FC). The Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) is a 55-center observational US registry of the demographics, disease course, and management of patients with World Health Organization (WHO) group 1 PAH. Methods: The REVEAL Registry enrolled newly and previously diagnosed patients aged ≥ 3 months with WHO group 1 PAH consecutively from March 2006 to December 2009. Demographics, disease characteristics, and hemodynamic data were collected at enrollment. Survival analysis was conducted by FC and other subgroups in patients aged ≥ 18 years. Results: Survival differences between previously diagnosed and newly diagnosed patients at 1 year (90.4% vs 86.3%) were maintained to 5 years; 5-year survival for previously diagnosed patients was 65.4% compared with 61.2% for newly diagnosed patients. Previously diagnosed patients in FC I, II, III, and IV had an estimated 5-year survival rate of 88.0%, 75.6%, 57.0%, and 27.2%, respectively, compared with 72.2%, 71.7%, 60.0%, and 43.8% for newly diagnosed patients in FC I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Conclusions: Patient survival of advanced PAH remains poor at 5 years despite treatment advances. New York Heart Association FC remains one of the most important predictors of future survival. These observations reinforce the importance of continuous monitoring of FC in patients with PAH.},

abstract = {Measuring similarity or distance between two entities is a key step for several data mining and knowledge discovery tasks. The notion of similarity for continuous data is relatively well-understood, but for categorical data, the similarity computation is not straightforward. Several data-driven similarity measures have been proposed in the literature to compute the similarity between two categorical data instances but their relative performance has not been evaluated. In this paper we study the performance of a variety of similarity measures in the context of a specific data mining task: outlier detection. Results on a variety of data sets show that while no one measure dominates others for all types of problems, some measures are able to have consistently high performance.

abstract = {Data clustering describes a set of frequently employed techniques in exploratory data analysis to extract "natural" group structure in data. Such groupings need to be validated to separate the signal in the data from spurious structure. In this context, finding an appropriate number of clusters is a particularly important model selection question. We introduce a measure of cluster stability to assess the validity of a cluster model. This stability measure quantifies the reproducibility of clustering solutions on a second sample, and it can be interpreted as a classification risk with regard to class labels produced by a clustering algorithm. The preferred number of clusters is determined by minimizing this classification risk as a function of the number of clusters. Convincing results are achieved on simulated as well as gene expression data sets. Comparisons to other methods demonstrate the competitive performance of our method and its suitability as a general validation tool for clustering solutions in real-world problems.},

abstract = {Continuous diagnostic tests are often used for discriminating between healthy and diseased populations. For the clinical application of such tests, it is useful to select a cutpoint or discrimination value c that deffnes positive and negative test results. In general, individuals with a diagnostic test value of c or higher are classiffed as diseased. Several search strategies have been proposed for choosing optimal cutpoints in diagnostic tests, depending on the underlying reason for this choice. This paper introduces an R package, known as OptimalCutpoints, for selecting optimal cutpoints in diagnostic tests. It incorporates criteria that take the costs of the different diagnostic decisions into account, as well as the prevalence of the target disease and several methods based on measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, it enables optimal levels to be calculated according to levels of given (categorical) covariates. While the numerical output includes the optimal cutpoint values and associated accuracy measures with their conffdence intervals, the graphical output includes the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and predictive ROC curves. An illustration of the use of OptimalCutpoints is provided, using a real biomedical dataset.},

abstract = {"A Chapman & Hall book." Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown presents a much easier way to write books and technical publications than traditional tools such as LaTeX and Word. The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C plus plus, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub. 1.

abstract = {Current European guidelines recommend periodic risk assessment for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The aim of our study was to determine the association between the number of low-risk criteria achieved within 1 year of diagnosis and long-term prognosis. Incident patients with idiopathic, heritable and drug-induced PAH between 2006 and 2016 were analysed. The number of low-risk criteria present at diagnosis and at first re-evaluation were assessed: World Health Organization (WHO)/New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I or II, 6-min walking distance (6MWD) >440 m, right atrial pressure <8 mmHg and cardiac index ≥2.5 L{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}m-2. 1017 patients were included (mean age 57 years, 59% female, 75% idiopathic PAH). After a median follow-up of 34 months, 238 (23%) patients had died. Each of the four low-risk criteria independently predicted transplant-free survival at first re-evaluation. The number of low-risk criteria present at diagnosis (p<0.001) and at first re-evaluation (p<0.001) discriminated the risk of death or lung transplantation. In addition, in a subgroup of 603 patients with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or Nterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements, the number of three noninvasive criteria (WHO/NYHA functional class, 6MWD and BNP/NT-proBNP) present at first re-evaluation discriminated prognostic groups (p<0.001). A simplified risk assessment tool that quantifies the number of low-risk criteria present accurately predicted transplant-free survival in PAH.},

@article{Benza2021,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Achievement of low-risk status is a treatment goal in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Risk assessment often is performed using multiparameter tools, such as the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) risk calculator. Risk calculators that assess fewer variables without compromising validity may expedite risk assessment in the routine clinic setting. We describe the development and validation of REVEAL Lite 2, an abridged version of REVEAL 2.0. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a simplified version of the REVEAL 2.0 risk assessment calculator for patients with PAH be developed and validated? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: REVEAL Lite 2 includes six noninvasive variables-functional class (FC), vital signs (systolic BP [SBP] and heart rate), 6-min walk distance (6MWD), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and renal insufficiency (by estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR])-and was validated in a series of analyses (Kaplan-Meier, concordance index, Cox proportional hazard model, and multivariate analysis). RESULTS: REVEAL Lite 2 approximates REVEAL 2.0 at discriminating low, intermediate, and high risk for 1-year mortality in patients in the REVEAL registry. The model indicated that the most highly predictive REVEAL Lite 2 parameter was BNP/NT-proBNP, followed by 6MWD and FC. Even if multiple, less predictive variables (heart rate, SBP, eGFR) were missing, REVEAL Lite 2 still discriminated among risk groups. INTERPRETATION: REVEAL Lite 2, an abridged version of REVEAL 2.0, provides a simplified method of risk assessment that can be implemented routinely in daily clinical practice. REVEAL Lite 2 is a robust tool that provides discrimination among patients at low, intermediate, and high risk of 1-year mortality.

abstract = {Background: This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of six different biomarkers in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and to explore whether a multi-biomarker approach can contribute to a better risk stratification. Methods: In this prospective study, patients with PH were included at the day of the diagnostic right heart catheterization between May 2012 and October 2016. Venous blood sampling included; NT-proBNP, high sensitive troponin-T, high sensitive CRP, galectin-3, red blood cell distribution width and eGFR. Associations between biomarker levels and the primary endpoint (death or lung transplantation) and secondary endpoint (death, lung transplantation or heart failure) were assessed with Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex. Additionally, adjustment for the REVEAL risk score was performed. Results: In total, 106 patients were included (median age 58.7 [IQR 47.0-69.2] years, 64% women, 51% pulmonary arterial hypertension). After a median follow-up duration of 23.9 [IQR 15.1-40.0] months, respectively 29 and 37 patients reached the primary and secondary endpoint. All six biomarkers, except eGFR, were significantly associated with the endpoints. A multi-biomarker approach including the number of elevated biomarkers per patient, demonstrated that patients were at higher risk of adverse events as more biomarker levels were elevated (HR for each extra elevated biomarker; 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.64, P =.01). However, a single as well as a combination of multiple biomarkers, did not yield prognostic value independent of the REVEAL risk score. Conclusions: Various biomarkers are associated with the event-free survival in adults with PH. However, risk stratification exclusively based on single or a combination of biomarkers seems not superior to existing risk scores.},

abstract = {Objective: To characterize mortality in persons diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension and to investigate factors associated with survival. Design: Registry with prospective follow-up. Setting: Thirty-two clinical centers in the United States participating in the Patient Registry for the Characterization of Primary Pulmonary Hypertension supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Patients: Patients (194) diagnosed at clinical centers between 1 July 1981 and 31 December 1985 and followed through 8 August 1988. Measurements: At diagnosis, measurements of hemodynamic variables, pulmonary function, and gas exchange variables were taken in addition to information on demographic variables, medical history, and life-style. Patients were followed for survival at 6-month intervals. Main Results: The estimated median survival of these patients was 2.8 years (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.7 years). Estimated single-year survival rates were as follows: at 1 year, 68% (CI, 61% to 75%); at 3 years, 48% (CI, 41% to 55%); and at 5 years, 34% (CI, 24% to 44%). Variables associated with poor survival included a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class of III or IV, presence of Raynaud phenomenon, elevated mean right atrial pressure, elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure, decreased cardiac index, and decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DL(CO)). Drug therapy at entry or discharge was not associated with survival duration. Conclusions: Mortality was most closely associated with right ventricular hemodynamic function and can be characterized by means of an equation using three variables: mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and cardiac index. Such an equation, once validated prospectively, could be used as an adjunct in planning treatment strategies and allocating medical resources.},

abstract = {Comparison is a fundamental method of scientific research leading to insights about the processes that generate similarity or dissimilarity. In statistical terms comparisons between probability functions are performed to infer connections, correlations, or relationships between objects or samples (Cha 2007). Most quantification methods rely on distance or similarity measures, but the right choice for each individual application is not always clear and sometimes poorly explored. The reason for this is partly that diverse measures are either implemented in different R packages with very different notations or are not implemented at all. Thus, a comprehensive framework implementing the most common similarity and distance measures using a uniform notation is still missing. The R (R Core Team 2018) package Philentropy aims to fill this gap by implementing forty-six fundamental distance and similarity measures (Cha 2007) for comparing probability functions. These comparisons between probability functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific disciplines from mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a comprehensive and computationally optimized base framework for clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit, non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are based on comparing univariate or multivari-ate probability functions. All functions are written in C++ and are integrated into the R package using the Rcpp Application Programming Interface (API) (Eddelbuettel 2013). Together, this framework allows building new similarity or distance based (statistical) models and algorithms in R which are computationally efficient and scalable. The comprehensive availability of diverse metrics and measures furthermore enables a systematic assessment of choosing the most optimal similarity or distance measure for individual applications in diverse scientific disciplines. The following probability distance/similarity and information theory measures are implemented in Philentropy.

abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In Euclidean geometry the mean—as used in k-means—is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster intialization strategies. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications.},

abstract = {Semi-supervised clustering which uses the limited labeled data to aid unsupervised clustering, has become a hot topic in recent years. But the limited labeled data may be imbalanced and can not cover all clusters in some cases and most of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms can not deal with imbalanced dataset well and have no the ability of detecting new clusters. In view of this, an adaptive semi-supervised clustering algorithm with label propagation is proposed. Two most of interesting characteristics of the proposed algorithm are that (1) It uses the limited labeled data to expand labeled dataset based on an adaptive threshold by labeling their k-nearest neighbors, (2) It detects whether there exist new clusters in the unlabeled dataset according to a proposed measure criterion. Three standard datasets are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed clustering algorithm is much higher than that of three compared algorithm and in addition the proposed algorithm has the ability of detecting new clusters. {\textcopyright} 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract = {Pulmonary hypertension is a substantial global health issue. All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1% of the global population, which increases up to 10% in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80% of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.},

abstract = {Imbalances of iron homeostasis are associated with an adverse clinical outcome of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Herein, we aimed to analyze the impact of iron deficiency (ID) in a real-life PH patient cohort according to different currently used ID definitions. In a retrospective study including 153 precapillary PH patients followed over a mean period of five years, iron deficiency was assessed according to five clinical definitions used in previous trials. The impact of ID on clinical, hematological and hemodynamic parameters was investigated. Depending on the different cutoff levels for serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, currently used ID definitions indicated a prevalence of either true or functional ID in 11 to 75 percent of PH patients. A good diagnostic accuracy was achieved by using the sTFRF/log ferritin (sTFRF) index, which identified 33 to 42 percent of PH patients as being iron deficient. The sTFRF index had the best prediction for the association between ID and clinical outcome. Iron deficient patients with precapillary PH had a significantly higher mortality as compared to non-iron deficiency subjects, which was true for both, PH patients with and without anemia. Although levels of the iron hormone hepcidin were rather affected by ID than by inflammation, they were not associated with the clinical course or mortality of PH subjects. To conclude, ID had a significant impact on the clinical course of precapillary PH patients. The appropriate use of robust biomarkers to define ID is a prerequisite to further evaluate the role of ID and the potential benefit of iron supplementation in precapillary PH patients.},

abstract = {Background: Risk assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) contributes to its management. Unfortunately, the existing risk assessment approaches are defective for clinicians to practice in daily clinical settings to some extent. Methods: We designed a modified Risk Assessment Score of PAH (mRASP) comprising four non-invasive variables which were World Health Organization functional class(WHO FC), 6-min walk distance (6MWD), N-terminal of the pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide(NT-pro BNP), and right atrial area(RAA), then validated it in the prediction of one-year survival rate for patients with PAH by contrast with the REVEAL risk score. Results: For the validation cohort(n = 216), the predicted one-year survival rate were 95-100%, 90-95%, and < 90% in the mRASP risk score strata of 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8, respectively; meanwhile, the observed one-year survival rates were 97.1, 92.6, and 52.2%, in each corresponding stratum, respectively. The mRASP (c-index = 0.727) demonstrated similar predictive power in contrast with the REVEAL risk assessment score (c-index = 0.715) in the prediction of one-year survival rate. Conclusion: The mRASP is an eligible risk assessment tool for the prognostic assessment of PAH. In contrast with the REVEAL score, it demonstrated similar predictive power and accuracy, with extra simplicity and convenience.},

abstract = {At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},

abstract = {Background: In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), survival predictions can be important for optimization of therapeutic strategies. The present study aimed to validate a quantitative algorithm for predicting survival derived from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) and develop a simplified calculator for everyday clinical use. Methods: Prospectively collected data from patients with newly diagnosed (< 3 months) World Health Organization group I pulmonary hypertension enrolled in the REVEAL Registry were used to validate a predictive algorithm for 1-year survival. Model calibration was evaluated by comparing algorithm-predicted survival with observed Kaplan-Meier estimates for the overall validation cohort and for five risk groups. Similarly, the risk discriminators for the simplified calculator were compared with those of the quantitative algorithm. Results: The validation cohort comprised 504 individuals with mean ± SD 6-min walk distance 308 ± 128 m, and 61.5% were functional class III. The proportion of patients surviving 1 year fell within the range predicted by the model (95.1%, 91.5%, 84.6%, 76.3%, and 58.2%, respectively) among patients in the low (predicted survival ≥ 95%), average (90% to < 95%), moderate (85% to < 90%), high (70% to < 85%), and very high (< 70%) risk strata. Predicted and observed 1-year survival were similar across risk stratum, and the c-index indicated good discrimination for both the full equation (0.726) and the simplified risk calculator (0.724). Conclusions: The REVEAL Registry predictive algorithm and simplified risk score calculator are well calibrated and demonstrate good discriminatory ability in patients with newly or previously diagnosed PAH.

abstract = {Aims The effect of macitentan on haemodynamic parameters and NT-proBNP levels was evaluated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients in the SERAPHIN study. Association between these parameters and disease progression, assessed by the primary endpoint (time to first morbidity/mortality event), was explored. Methods and results Of the 742 randomized patients, 187 with right heart catheterization at baseline and month 6 participated in a haemodynamic sub-study. Prespecified endpoints included change from baseline to month 6 in cardiac index (CI), right atrial pressure (RAP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), mixed-venous oxygen saturation, and NT-proBNP. Exploratory analyses examined associations between CI, RAP, and NT-proBNP and disease progression using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models. Macitentan improved CI, RAP, mPAP, PVR and NT-proBNP vs. placebo at month 6. Absolute levels of CI, RAP and NT-proBNP at baseline and month 6, but not their changes, were associated with morbidity/mortality events. Patients with CI> 2.5 L/min/m2, RAP < 8 mmHg, or NTproBNP < 750 fmol/ml at month 6 had a lower risk of morbidity/mortality than those not meeting these thresholds (HR 0.49, 95% CL 0.28-0.86; HR 0.72, 95% CL 0.42-1.22; and HR 0.22, 95% CL 0.15-0.33, respectively). Conclusions For all treatment groups, baseline and month 6 values of CI, RAP, and NT-proBNP, but not their changes, were associated with morbidity/mortality events, confirming their relevance in predicting disease progression in patients with PAH. By improving those parameters, macitentan increased the likelihood of reaching threshold values associated with lower risk of morbidity/mortality.},

abstract = {Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is well known to affect folic acid metabolism, so MTX treatment can result in alterations of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which may impact on red cell distribution width (RDW), as MCV levels feed into RDW calculation. We thus questioned whether RDW levels and subsequently its diagnostic utility in RA subjects, as reported before, are influenced by ongoing MTX therapy. We assessed the impact of disease modifying drug (DMARD) treatment, especially MTX, on RDW and evaluated their influence on the predictive value of RDW for cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As far as we know, this is the first study evaluating the influence of MTX on RDW. Methods: Medical treatment, disease activity, laboratory parameters and history of CV events were retrospectively analysed in 385 RA patients at disease onset and at last follow up at our clinic. Additionally, in patients with CV event, data were recorded at last follow up prior the CV event. Results: Disease parameters and laboratory findings associated with a serious vascular event were older age (p < 0,001), longer disease duration (p = 0,002) and a higher RDW at diagnosis (p = 0,025). No differences in RDW levels became evident with any other treatment regimen beside MTX. MTX treated patients had significantly higher RDW compared to subjects without this drug (p < 0,001). In RA patients without MTX treatment, we found RDW level significantly different between those with versus without a CV event, whereas this difference disappeared in subjects receiving MTX. Conclusion: MTX impacts on RDW and might therefor reduce its prognostic value for CV events in patients taking MTX, whereas an increased RDW at diagnosis remains an early risk predictor for myocardial infarction and stroke in RA patients.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to understand the prevalence and clinical relevance of iron deficiency in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Background: Iron availability influences the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia in humans and may be significant in the pathogenesis of IPAH. Methods: Iron deficiency, defined by raised levels of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), was investigated in 98 patients with IPAH. Hepcidin and erythropoietin (EPO) levels were also measured. The effect of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor knockdown on BMP-6stimulated hepcidin production was assessed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Relationships between sTfR and exercise capacity, functional class, and all-cause mortality were analyzed. Results: Circulating sTfR levels were raised in 63% of IPAH patients, indicating significant iron deficiency. Consistent with this, iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation levels were reduced and red cell distribution width increased, without overt anemia. Hepcidin correlated inversely with sTfR and positively with increasing ferritin. Hepcidin was inappropriately raised in IPAH independent of the inflammatory marker interleukin-6. EPO levels were also raised and correlated inversely with hepcidin. BMP receptor-type 2 (BMPR2) knockdown in HepG2 cells increased BMP-6stimulated hepcidin expression. sTfR increased with World Health Organization functional class (p < 0.05), correlated negatively with exercise capacity (p = 0.027), and values >28.1 nmol/l independently predicted survival (p = 0.011). Conclusions: Iron deficiency is common in IPAH patients and associated with disease severity and poor clinical outcome. Inappropriately raised hepcidin levels, which impair iron absorption from the gut, may be a factor. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine contemporary survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and to investigate whether or not the National Institutes of Health (NIH) equation remains an accurate predictor of survival. In 576 patients with PAH referred during 1991-2007, observed survival was described using the Kaplan-Meier method. In patients with idiopathic, familial and anorexigen-associated PAH (n=247), observed versus NIH equation predicted survival was compared. A new survival prediction equation was developed using exponential regression analysis. The observed 1-, 3- and 5-yr survival in the total cohort were 86, 69 and 61%, respectively. In patients with idiopathic, familial and anorexigen-associated PAH, the observed 1-, 3- and 5-yr survival (92, 75 and 66%, respectively) were significantly higher than the predicted survival (65, 43 and 32%, respectively). The new equation (P(t)=e -A(x,y,z)t, where P(t) is probability of survival, t the time interval in years, A(x,y,z)=e(-1.270-0.0148x+0.0402y-0.361z), x the mean pulmonary artery pressure, y the mean right atrial pressure and z the cardiac index) performed well when applied to published contemporary studies of survival in PAH. Contemporary survival in the PAH cohort was better than that predicted by the NIH registry equation. The NIH equation underestimated survival in idiopathic, familial and anorexigenassociated PAH. Once prospectively validated, the new equation may be used to determine prognosis. Copyright{\textcopyright}ERS Journals Ltd 2010.},

abstract = {Background: NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide) levels are included in the multiparametric risk assessment approach for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) outlined in PAH guidelines. However, data supporting the use of NT-proBNP risk thresholds in assessing prognosis in PAH are limited. The GRIPHON trial (Prostacyclin [PGI2] Receptor Agonist In Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) provides an opportunity to assess the prognostic value of NT-proBNP thresholds in a controlled clinical trial and to evaluate the response to selexipag according to these thresholds. Methods: The event-driven GRIPHON trial randomly assigned patients to selexipag or placebo. NT-proBNP was measured at regular intervals in GRIPHON. Here, patients were categorized post hoc into low, medium, and high NT-proBNP subgroups according to 2 independent sets of thresholds: (1) baseline tertiles: <271 ng/L; 271 to 1165 ng/L; >1165 ng/L; and (2) 2015 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines cutoffs: <300 ng/L; 300 to 1400 ng/L; >1400 ng/L. Hazard ratios (selexipag versus placebo) with 95% CIs were calculated for the primary end point (composite morbidity/mortality events) by NT-proBNP category at baseline using Cox proportional-hazards models, and at any time during the exposure period using a time-dependent Cox model. Results: With both thresholds, baseline and follow-up NT-proBNP categories were highly prognostic for future morbidity/mortality events during the study (P<0.0001). In the time-dependent analysis, the risk of experiencing a morbidity/mortality event was 92% and 83% lower in selexipag-treated patients with a low and medium NT-proBNP level, and 90% and 56% lower in placebo-treated patients with a low and medium NT-proBNP level, in comparison with patients with a high NT-proBNP level. Selexipag reduced the risk of morbidity/mortality events across all 3 NT-proBNP categories in both the baseline and time-dependent analyses, with a more pronounced treatment benefit of selexipag seen in the medium and low NT-proBNP subgroups (interaction P values 0.20 and 0.007 in the baseline and time-dependent analyses). Conclusions: These analyses further establish the prognostic relevance of NT-proBNP levels in PAH and provide first evidence for the association of NT-proBNP level and treatment response. Using 2 similar sets of thresholds, these analyses support the relevance of the low, medium, and high NT-proBNP categories as part of the multiparametric risk assessment approach outlined in the European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines for the management of PAH patients.},

abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a severe clinical condition despite the availability over the past 15 years of multiple drugs interfering with the endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathways. The recent progress observed in medical therapy of PAH is not, therefore, related to the discovery of new pathways, but to the development of new strategies for combination therapy and on escalation of treatments based on systematic assessment of clinical response. The current treatment strategy is based on the severity of the newly diagnosed PAH patient as assessed by a multiparametric risk stratification approach. Clinical, exercise, right ventricular function and haemodynamic parameters are combined to define a low-, intermediate- or high-risk status according to the expected 1-year mortality. The current treatment algorithm provides the most appropriate initial strategy, including monotherapy, or double or triple combination therapy. Further treatment escalation is required in case low-risk status is not achieved in planned follow-up assessments. Lung transplantation may be required in most advanced cases on maximal medical therapy.},

abstract = {Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive, fatal disease. Published treatment guidelines recommend treatment escalation on the basis of regular patient assessment with the goal of achieving or maintaining low-risk status. Various strategies are available to determine risk status. This analysis describes an update of the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) risk calculator (REVEAL 2.0) and compares it with recently published European Society of Cardiology/Respiratory Society guideline-derived risk assessment strategies. Methods: A subpopulation from the US-based registry REVEAL that survived ≥ 1 year postenrollment (baseline for this cohort) was analyzed. For REVEAL 2.0, point values and cutpoints were reassessed, and new variables were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival at 12 months postbaseline; discrimination was quantified using the c-statistic. Mortality estimates and discrimination were compared between REVEAL 2.0 and Comparative, Prospective Registry of Newly Initiated Therapies for Pulmonary Hypertension (COMPERA) and French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry (FPHR) risk assessment strategies. For this comparison, a three-category REVEAL 2.0 score was computed in which patients were classified as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk. Results: REVEAL 2.0 demonstrated similar discrimination as the original calculator in this subpopulation (c-statistic = 0.76 vs 0.74), provided excellent separation of risk among the risk categories, and predicted clinical worsening as well as mortality in patients who were followed ≥ 1 year. The REVEAL 2.0 three-category score had greater discrimination (c-statistic = 0.73) than COMPERA (c-statistic = 0.62) or FPHR (c-statistic = 0.64). Compared with REVEAL 2.0, COMPERA and FPHR both underestimated and overestimated risk. Conclusions: REVEAL 2.0 demonstrates greater risk discrimination than the COMPERA and FPHR risk assessment strategies in patients enrolled in REVEAL. After external validation, the REVEAL 2.0 calculator can assist clinicians and patients in making informed treatment decisions on the basis of individual risk profiles.

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Anaemia is mainly caused by disturbances of iron homeostasis. While absolute iron deficiency mostly as a consequence of chronic blood loss or insufficient dietary iron absorption results in the emergence of iron deficiency anaemia, inflammation-driven iron retention in innate immune cells and blockade of iron absorption leads to the development of anaemia of chronic disease. Both, iron deficiency and anaemia have been linked to the clinical course of pulmonary hypertension. Various mechanistic links between iron homeostasis, anaemia, and pulmonary hypertension have been described and current treatment guidelines suggest regular iron status assessment and the implementation of iron supplementation strategies in these patients. The pathophysiology, diagnostic assessment as well as current and future treatment options concerning iron deficiency with or without anaemia in individuals suffering from pulmonary hypertension are discussed within this review.},

abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

abstract = {Aims Guidelines recommend a goal-oriented treatment approach in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The aim is to reach a low-risk profile, as determined by a risk assessment instrument. This strategy is incompletely validated. We aimed to investigate the bearing of such risk assessment and the benefit of reaching a low-risk profile. Methods and results Five hundred and thirty PAH patients were included. Follow-up assessments performed after a median of 4 (interquartile range 3-5) months were available for 383 subjects. Patients were classified as -Low-, 'Intermediate', or 'High risk' and the benefit of reaching the 'Low risk' group was estimated. Survival differed (P < 0.001) between the risk groups at baseline and at follow-up. Survival was similar for patients who remained in or improved to the 'Low risk' group. Survival was similar for patients who remained in or worsened to the 'Intermediate risk' or 'High risk' groups. Irrespective of follow-up risk group, survival was better (P < 0.001) for patients with a higher proportion of variables at low risk. Results were unchanged after excluding patients with idiopathic PAH >65 years at diagnosis, and when patients with idiopathic or connective tissue disease-associated PAH were analysed separately. Patients in the 'Low risk' group at follow-up exhibited a reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.1'0.4 in multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex and PAH subset), as compared to patients in the 'Intermediate risk' or 'High risk' groups. Conclusion These findings suggest that comprehensive risk assessments and the aim of reaching a low-risk profile are valid in PAH.},

abstract = {Developments in whole genome biotechnology have stimulated statistical focus on prediction methods. We review here methodology for classifying patients into survival risk groups and for using cross-validation to evaluate such classifications. Measures of discrimination for survival risk models include separation of survival curves, time-dependent ROC curves and Harrell's concordance index. For high-dimensional data applications, however, computing these measures as re-substitution statistics on the same data used for model development results in highly biased estimates. Most developments in methodology for survival risk modeling with high-dimensional data have utilized separate test data sets for model evaluation. Cross-validation has sometimes been used for optimization of tuning parameters. In many applications, however, the data available are too limited for effective division into training and test sets and consequently authors have often either reported re-substitution statistics or analyzed their data using binary classification methods in order to utilize familiar cross-validation. In this article we have tried to indicate how to utilize cross-validation for the evaluation of survival risk models; specifically how to compute cross-validated estimates of survival distributions for predicted risk groups and how to compute cross-validated time-dependent ROC curves. We have also discussed evaluation of the statistical significance of a survival risk model and evaluation of whether high-dimensional genomic data adds predictive accuracy to a model based on standard covariates alone.

It may result from common diseases such as left-sided heart or lung disease or may present as the rare entity of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Biomarkers that specifically indicate the pathologic mechanism, the severity of the disease, and the treatment response would be ideal tools for the management of PH. In this review, markers related to heart failure, inflammation, hemostasis, remodeling, and endothelial cell-smooth muscle cell interaction are discussed, and their limitations are emphasized. Anemia, hypocarbia, elevated uric acid, and C-reactive protein levels are unspecific markers of disease severity. Brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide have been recommended in current guidelines, whereas other prognostic markers, such as growth differentiation factor-15, osteopontin, and red cell distribution width, are emerging. Chemokines of the CC family and matrix metalloproteases have been linked to the vascular pathologic mechanisms, and new markers such as apelin have been described. Circulating endothelial and progenitor cells have received much attention as markers of disease activity, but with controversial findings. A lack of standards for cell isolation and characterization methods and differences in the pathologic mechanisms of the investigated patients may have contributed to the discrepancies. In conclusion, although several promising markers have been identified over the past few years, the development of more specific markers, standardization, and prospective validation are warranted. {\textcopyright} 2013 American College of Chest Physicians.},

abstract = {The 2015 European pulmonary hypertension (PH) guidelines propose a risk stratification strategy for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Low-, intermediate- and high-risk strata are defined by estimated 1-year mortality risks of <5%, 5-10% and >10%, respectively. This risk assessment strategy awaits validation. We analysed data from patients with newly diagnosed PAH enrolled into COMPERA (Comparative, Prospective Registry of Newly Initiated Therapies for Pulmonary Hypertension), a European-based PH registry. An abbreviated version of the risk assessment strategy proposed by the European PH guidelines was applied, using the following variables: World Health Organization functional class, 6-min walking distance, brain natriuretic peptide or its N-terminal fragment, right atrial pressure, cardiac index and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Data from 1588 patients were analysed. Mortality rates were significantly different between the three risk strata (p<0.001 for all comparisons). In the entire patient population, the observed mortality rates 1 year after diagnosis were 2.8% in the low-risk cohort (n=196), 9.9% in the intermediate-risk cohort (n=1116) and 21.2% in the high-risk cohort (n=276). In addition, the risk assessment strategy proved valid at follow-up and in major PAH subgroups. An abbreviated version of the risk assessment strategy proposed by the current European PH guidelines provides accurate mortality estimates in patients with PAH.},

Package dbscan uses advanced open-source spatial indexing data structures implemented in C++ to speed up computation. An important advantage of this implementation is that it is up-to-date with several improvements that have been added since the original algorithms were publications (e.g., artifact corrections and dendrogram extraction methods for OPTICS). We provide a consistent presentation of the DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithms, and compare dbscan's implementation with other popular libraries such as the R package fpc, ELKI, WEKA, PyClustering, SciKit-Learn, and SPMF in terms of available features and using an experimental comparison.},

abstract = {The results of a standard principal component analysis (PCA) can be affected by the presence of outliers. Hence robust alternatives to PCA are needed. One of the most appealing robust methods for principal component analysis uses the Projection-Pursuit principle. Here, one projects the data on a lower-dimensional space such that a robust measure of variance of the projected data will be maximized. The Projection-Pursuit-based method for principal component analysis has recently been introduced in the field of chemometrics, where the number of variables is typically large. In this paper, it is shown that the currently available algorithm for robust Projection-Pursuit PCA performs poor in the presence of many variables. A new algorithm is proposed that is more suitable for the analysis of chemical data. Its performance is studied by means of simulation experiments and illustrated on some real data sets. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

abstract = {Background: Current pulmonary hypertension treatment guidelines recommend use of a risk stratification model encompassing a range of parameters, allowing patients to be categorised as low, intermediate or high risk. Three abbreviated versions of this risk stratification model were previously evaluated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the French, Swedish and COMPERA registries. Our objective was to investigate the three abbreviated risk stratification methods for patients with mostly prevalent PAH and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), in patients from the PATENT-1/2 and CHEST-1/2 studies of riociguat. Methods: Risk was assessed at baseline and at follow-up in PATENT-1 and CHEST-1. Survival and clinical worsening-free survival were assessed in patients in each risk group/strata. Results: With all three methods, riociguat improved risk group/strata in patients with PAH after 12 weeks. The French non-invasive and Swedish/COMPERA methods discriminated prognosis for survival and clinical worsening-free survival at both baseline and follow-up. Furthermore, patients achieving one or more low-risk criteria or a low-risk stratum at follow-up had a significantly reduced risk of death and clinical worsening compared with patients achieving no low-risk criteria or an intermediate-risk stratum. Similar results were obtained in patients with inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH. Conclusions: This analysis confirms and extends the results of the registry analyses, supporting the value of goal-oriented treatment in PAH. Further assessment of these methods in patients with CTEPH is warranted.},

I reviewed a sample of ROC curve plots from the major oncology journals in order to assess current trends in usage and design elements. My review suggests that ROC curve plots are often ineffective as statistical charts and that poor design obscures the relevant information the chart is intended to display. I describe my new R package that was created to address the shortcomings of existing tools. The package has functions to create informative ROC curve plots, with sensible defaults and a simple interface, for use in print or as an interactive web-based plot.

abstract = {No prior proteomic screening study has centred on the right ventricle (RV) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This study investigates the circulating proteomic profile associated with right heart maladaptive phenotype (RHMP) in PAH. Plasma proteomic profiling was performed using multiplex immunoassay in 121 (discovery cohort) and 76 (validation cohort) PAH patients. The association between proteomic markers and RHMP, defined by the Mayo right heart score (combining RV strain, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)) and Stanford score (RV end-systolic remodelling index, NYHA class and NT-proBNP), was assessed by partial least squares regression. Biomarker expression was measured in RV samples from PAH patients and controls, and pulmonary artery banding (PAB) mice. High levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), stem cell growth factor-$\beta$, nerve growth factor and stromal derived factor-1 were associated with worse Mayo and Stanford scores independently from pulmonary resistance or pressure in both cohorts (the validation cohort had more severe disease features: lower cardiac index and higher NT-proBNP). In both cohorts, HGF added value to the REVEAL score in the prediction of death, transplant or hospitalisation at 3 years. RV expression levels of HGF and its receptor c-Met were higher in end-stage PAH patients than controls, and in PAB mice than shams. High plasma HGF levels are associated with RHMP and predictive of 3-year clinical worsening. Both HGF and c-Met RV expression levels are increased in PAH. Assessing plasma HGF levels might identify patients at risk of heart failure who warrant closer follow-up and intensified therapy.},

abstract = {Background: A prognostic model should not enter clinical practice unless it has been demonstrated that it performs a useful role. External validation denotes evaluation of model performance in a sample independent of that used to develop the model. Unlike for logistic regression models, external validation of Cox models is sparsely treated in the literature. Successful validation of a model means achieving satisfactory discrimination and calibration (prediction accuracy) in the validation sample. Validating Cox models is not straightforward because event probabilities are estimated relative to an unspecified baseline function. Methods. We describe statistical approaches to external validation of a published Cox model according to the level of published information, specifically (1) the prognostic index only, (2) the prognostic index together with Kaplan-Meier curves for risk groups, and (3) the first two plus the baseline survival curve (the estimated survival function at the mean prognostic index across the sample). The most challenging task, requiring level 3 information, is assessing calibration, for which we suggest a method of approximating the baseline survival function. Results: We apply the methods to two comparable datasets in primary breast cancer, treating one as derivation and the other as validation sample. Results are presented for discrimination and calibration. We demonstrate plots of survival probabilities that can assist model evaluation. Conclusions: Our validation methods are applicable to a wide range of prognostic studies and provide researchers with a toolkit for external validation of a published Cox model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royston and Altman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},
