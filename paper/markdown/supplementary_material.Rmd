# Supplementary Methods

## Data transformation, visualization, descriptive statistic

Data transformation, analysis and result visualization was accomplished by R version 4.0.5 with _tidyverse_ environment[@Wickham2019; @Wickham2016]. Figures were generated with _cowplot_ package [@Wilke2019], Supplementary Material file was built with _rmarkdown_ environment (packages _knitr_, _rmarkdown_, _kableExtra_ and _bookdown_) [@Xie2016]. 

For univariable survival modeling and construction of candidate risk signatures, a set of categorical `r nrow(pah_study$mod_variables)` demographic, biochemical, right-heart catheter, laboratory, ultrasound and lung function parameters recorded at PH diagnosis was used. For the list of modeling variables and their stratification scheme, see: __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-study-variables)__.

## Hypothesis testing, multiple comparisons

As the majority of the analyzed numeric variables were non-normally distributed as checked by Shapiro-Wilk test, differences in median values between analysis groups were investigated by Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. Differences in survival between groups were compared by Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis, Mentel-Henszel and log-rank test [@Harrington1982], as appropriate. KM analysis and visualization of its results were done with tools provided by _survival_ and _survminer_ packages [@Kassambara2016] and home-developed wrappers (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/KM-Toolbox).

For each analysis and cohort, p values were corrected for multiple comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg method [@Benjamini1995]. 

## Univariable Cox survival modeling

Association of candidate categorical variables (__Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-study-variables)__) with overall survival time was assessed by series of univariable Cox proportional hazard models constructed for the Innsbruck and Linz/Vienna cohort using _survival_ package [@Therneau2000] and home-developed wrappers (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/KM-Toolbox). Significance of the hazard ratio estimates was determined by Wald Z test. P values were corrected for multiple comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg method [@Benjamini1995]. For the full modeling results, see: __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-uni-cox)__.

## Development of custom risk signatures

Candidate risk signatures (n = `r length(multi_modeling$training_models$models)`) were constructed as all possible combinations of 2 - 4 modeling variables (__Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-study-variables)__). The development and selection of significant risk signatures involved a 3-step procedure (__Figure 3A__):

__(1) Identification of the significant signatures in the PAH training Innsbruck cohort.__ Correlation of the candidate signatures with overall survival time was investigated in the training Innsbruck cohort by multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling (_survival_ package) [@Therneau2000]. Out of `r length(multi_modeling$training_models$models)` tested signatures a total of `r length(multi_modeling$training_signif$models)` variable combinations displayed (__A__) significant hazard ratios for all model components (Wald Z test), (__B__) significant Harrell's  concordance index (C-index, 2.5% confidence interval limit > 0.5, _concordance()_ function, _survival_ package) [@Harrell1996; @Therneau2000] and (__C__) Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted significance in likelihood ratio test versus the respective NULL model. For the complete multivariable Cox modeling results in the test cohort, see: __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-multi-cox)__.

__(2) Cross-validation (CV) in the training Innsbruck cohort.__ Ability of the signatures identified in Step 1 to reproduciblly predict overall survival in the training Innsbruck cohort was assessed with 20-fold cross-validation essentially as described in [@Simon2011]. Briefly, for each training - test split of the Innsbruck cohort and the given variable combination, a multi-parameter Cox model was constructed in the training subset, and its linear predictor values calculated in the test subset. Association of the linear predictor score in the test subset with survival was measured by C-index statistic. Out of the `r length(multi_modeling$training_signif$models)` signatures subjected to CV, `r length(multi_modeling$cv_pass$models)` showed significant C-index values (2.5% confidence interval limit > 0.5). 

__(3) External validation in the PAH test Linz/Vienna cohort.__ The external validation procedure was based on procedure described in [@Royston2013]. For the signatures passing the CV selection in Step 2 linear predictor scores based on the training cohort Cox model estimates (see: __Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-score-formulas)__ for the formulas) were calculated in the test Linz/Vienna cohort. Correlation of the linear predictor scores with overall survival in the testing cohort was assessed by Cox proportional hazard modeling and C-index statistic. All `r length(multi_modeling$cv_pass$models)` CV-passing risk signatures demonstrated significant association with overall survival in the test cohort.

Values of mean squared errors and C-indexes in the training cohort (Step 1), cross-validation (Step 2) and test (Step 3) cohort are presented in __Figure 2__ and __Supplementary Figure \@ref(fig:fig-fit-errors)__.

## Modeling of 5-year mortality

Linear predictor scores for the developed `r length(multi_modeling$cv_pass$models)` risk signatures (__Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:tab-score-formulas)__) were calculated in the test Innsbruck and training Linz/Vienna cohort. Association of the score values with 5-year mortality was assessed with logistic regression (generalized linear modeling, log-link function, binomial family) and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC). Optimal score cutoffs were determined by maximizing the Youden J statistic. Score cutoff, sensitivity, specificity and area-under the curve value determination were done with _optimal.cutpoints_ package [@Lopez-Raton2014]. ROC curve plotting was accomplished by _plotROC_ package tools [@Sachs2017].
